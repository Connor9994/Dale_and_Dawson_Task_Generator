## Installation (Alternative)

2. Run "Task_Generator.exe" from inside of the "Task_Generator_EXE" folder

## Usage

Run the application and keep the window visible on your screen. Click "Generate New Tasks" to get a fresh set of 3 tasks. The color coding helps you identify which tasks are actual work (blue) and which are slacker activities (red).
